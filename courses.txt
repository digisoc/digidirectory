Because of this, the oceans exert a major influence on the Earth&#39;s climate and shipping operations. The three-year major program covers key principles of oceanography and the related issues of meteorology and climate. It offers a comprehensive account of physical oceanography, including components that cover waves, currents, sonar, and remote sensing, and employs mathematical arguments to describe the physical phenomena that take place within the world&#39;s oceans. It provides all future ADF officers with a sound understanding of the influence of oceans and weather. Double Majors of Oceanography with either Physics or Mathematics cover the requirements for a position at RAN&#39;s METOC (Meteorology and Oceanography) office."}, {"code": "ZPEMOH", "title": "Oceanography", "description": "The Oceanography Honours stream introduces undergraduate students to oceanography and related issues of meteorology and climate research.
